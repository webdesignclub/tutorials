<!-- Basic Setup for ALL HTML documents -->

<!DOCTYPE html>             <!-- Tells the browser that this is an HTML document -->
<html>                      <!-- Start of the HTML -->
<head>                      <!-- "head" contains setup code that isn't seen by the user. -->
    <title>Home</title>     <!-- Gives the page a title in the tab on your browser -->
</head>                     <!-- Closes the head tag -->
<body>                      <!-- Anything you want to display on your website goes in the body tags -->

  </body>                   <!-- Closes the Body tag -->
</html>                     <!-- Closes the HTML tag -->
